      Suggest a site for the Local Plan
    </h1>

    <p>To meet the needs of our residents and businesses up
      to 2040, we may need to
      identify additional land for development as part of our Local Plan 2040.
    </p>

    <p>We want to look at a number of options, so we can
      choose the most suitable sites
      for new developments.</p>

    <p>If you have any suggestions for sites that should be
      considered when we are
      developing the Local Plan, we want to hear from you. This is known as a
      'call for sites'.</p>

    <p>This call for sites doesn't determine how many new developments we need,
      or
      which sites will be allocated for development. It's an opportunity for
      local
      residents, community groups, business operators, landowners and developers
      to
      suggest sites that they would like to be considered as part of the Local
      Plan
      2040</p>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Who can suggest a site
      </summary>
      <p>Anyone can suggest a site to us. When you submit
        a site,
        we'll ask you what your connection to the site is, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the landowner</li>
        <li>a developer</li>
        <li>a business operator</li>
        <li>a local resident</li>
        <li>a community group</li>
        <li>any other type of connection to the site</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don't have to own a site to suggest it. If
        you don't
        own the site, but know who does, it's helpful if you tell us. If you
        don't know
        who owns it, you can still suggest the site and we will look into
        who owns
        it.</p>
    </details>


    <details>
      <summary>
        What type of site or development you can suggest
      </summary>
      <p>
        You can suggest any site that you would like to be considered. We'll
        look at how
        it meets the needs for new development in your local authority area
        between now
        and 2040.
      </p>

      <p>You can suggest sites for a wide range of uses,
        including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>housing - including specialist housing such as market-led
          housing, 100%</li>
        <li>affordable housing, older-persons housing, student housing, and
          self-build</li>
        <li>housing</li>
        <li>Gypsy and Traveller sites</li>
        <li>Travelling Show-persons sites</li>
        <li>industry - including distribution and logistics uses</li>
        <li>commercial uses - including offices, retail, leisure, hotel and
          mixed commercial uses</li>
        <li>community uses</li>
        <li>minerals - extraction, processing and so on</li>
        <li>waste - recycling, processing and so on</li>
        <li>tourism</li>
        <li>new public green space</li>
        <li>renewable energy</li>
        <li>energy storage</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you think that there could be more than one suitable use for a
        site, you can
        let us know when you submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can suggest a site for more than one use either in combination
        (for example,
        housing and commercial uses together) or separately (for example,
        all housing or
        all commercial development).
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary>
        What happens to the sites that are suggested
      </summary>
      <p>The call for sites will help us identify a list
        of sites for consideration.</p>

      <p class="govukBody">Once the call for sites is closed, we'll publish:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk--bullet">
        <li>the boundaries of all the sites that have been submitted</li>
        <li>the use or uses that they have been suggested for</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We'll publish this information on our website.
      </p>

      <p>Not every site that's submitted to us will be
        suitable for development. We also won't think all of the proposed
        developments are needed. So if a site is published on our website,
        that doesn't mean it will definitely be redeveloped.</p>

      <p>Over the coming months, we will look at how much
        and what sorts of developments are needed in your local authority
        area between now and 2040. We will also consider if more land needs
        to be allocated for development to meet these needs.</p>

      <p>If this work identifies more land is needed for
        one or more of the uses we've identified, we will assess all the
        site suggestions to determine which ones are suitable.</p>

      <p>We'll consider a wide range of sustainability
        considerations, including:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>environmental considerations</li>
        <li>transport</li>
        <li>the roles of places</li>
        <li>infrastructure</li>
        <li>flooding</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We'll also consider what benefits a new
        development may bring to the area, and any issues that might affect
        the site - such as contamination.</p>

      <p>Once we know what sites could be suitable for
        development, we'll work with local communities to make decisions
        about which options would be best to develop. We'll undertake
        further consultation to help inform these decisions.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>
        What land will be developed
      </summary>
      <p>At this early stage in the process, we don't
        know yet what
        land might be developed.&nbsp;It will depend on what needs are
        identified for the
        area, and what the overall strategy for distributing development
        looks like.
        We'll undertake further consultation to help inform these decisions.

        How to submit a site suggestion
      </summary>
      <p>We've developed a site selection form to provide
        a simple way to submit site suggestions for our Local Plan 2040 call
        for sites. If you need support, there's guidance in the form to help
        you complete each step.</p>
